<h3>Dress code</h3>

<p>We have a mild preference toward fabulous, but would much prefer you to wear whatever makes you feel comfortable. No nudity at this one, we're afraid.</p>

<h3>Behaviour</h3>

<p>We would encourage people to be lovely to one another, relax, and enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>The wedding will bring together many of our friends and family, who between them bring a diversity of backgrounds, identities and beliefs. This includes people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer, trans, nonmonogamous, and neurodiverse. Bluntly, lots of our friends are queer, as are we. We trust and expect that all our guests will respect our identities and life choices, and those of our other guests and our other partners.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about this you are welcome to contact us, but we are generally not going to restrict public displays of affection. The day is a celebration of love and commitment, not of exclusivity.</p>

<h3>Accommodation</h3>

<p>We will be staying at the Bermondsey Square Hotel for the weekend as a nod to our previous abode (and because they have a suite with an 8 person hot tub) and they are offering us a modest discount for any further rooms - Â£140 for a 'Superior double room' with breakfast for the night of 18th June.</p>
<p>We're hoping to get the rate down further, but please let us know if you want in on this offer (or to RSVP for the inevitable hot tub party)!</p>
<p>We know this isn't the most budget-friendly option so if you're coming from out of town and need help with accommodation, please let us know so we can try to help with other recommendations.</p>

<h3>Child friendliness</h3>

<p>Children are welcome. There will be a small side room set aside, and we're booking a childminder to be onsite. Please get in touch if you have preferences or suggestions on this.</p>

<h3>Gift registry</h3>
<p>We'll add one of these shortly.</p>
